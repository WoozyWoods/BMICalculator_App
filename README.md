# BMICalculator_App
 BMI Calculator is a stylish Health app. In this app I learned Flutter themes, how to refactor Flutter Widgets, Dart Final vs. Const, the GestureDetector Widget, Dart Enums, Dart Ternary Operator, Dart Functions as first order objects, the Flutter Slider Widget, custom Flutter Widgets, Multi-Screen apps using Routes and Navigation, and Dart Maps.
